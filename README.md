A self-contained smart shopping cart would take some of the burdens off the shoulders of the shopper.
One of the most obvious burdens in market shopping is to push and maneuver the cart between the
aisles. Therefore, a self-powered cart that follows the shopper autonomously is required.
Another burden in market shopping is waiting in the cashier’s line, emptying the whole cart in front of
the cashier and reloading it to make the payment. Ability to recognize and register an item while it is
being placed in the cart and to calculate the total amount to be paid at the end is required. This feature
should be mostly automatic; it can resort to semi-automatic solutions only for limited cases when
automation fails.
Your task is to design and construct a scaled-down model of such a cart as a proof of concept. The model should:
• Have a 15-litre container,
• Be capable of handling,
• at least 10 different kinds of goods,
• a total weight up to 2 kilograms,
• Allow for item removal,
• Present precautions against illegal use of the system,
• Follow the shopper autonomously,
• Provide collision avoidance,
• Be completely self-contained except for a possible interaction with the shopper.
The final product must be demonstrated for a store plan consisting of at least 2 parallel shelves, reachable from both sides.
